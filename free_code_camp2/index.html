                <h2>TAIMASCARO EXPRESSION:</h2>
                <p>Since the end of the last century, there is information about the carnival in the city of Puerto Plata, which was enriched by the arrival of Cuban groups at the beginning of this century.
                    Despite the socio-economic transformations, the result of a tourist development that surpassed expectations and forecasts, the rise of a carnival in search of identity has occurred in the last ten years, due to the effort and creative capacity of a generation of restless young people.
                    The taimáscaro reproduces Taino deities in his masks, with a beautiful costume, where elements of Spanish culture are symbolized and the African essences in his arms are symbolized by multicoloured ribbons, which are complemented by the Atlantic snails as the identity of the people of Puerto Plata.</p>

                <h2>DEFINITION OF TAIMASCARO:</h2>
                <p>This character brings together elements of the three cultures that came together on the island of Quisqueya during the time of colonization; Europeans, Afro-Antilleans, and primitive Tainos, whose images of their naive gods are today the faces of the most popular expression of the carnival in Puerto Plata. Taimáscaro is not just a costume, with more than a dozen tribes, it is a representation of art and culture, and of the thought of solidarity between the men of our people, our country and our world.</p>

                <h2>TAIMASCARO ORIGIN:</h2>
                <p>It arose in 1991, when a group of professionals from Puerto Plata, graduates in different professions and different universities, returned to their town. We found our contemporaries submerged in the lethargy of the time of great radical waiting for the change of their lives.
                    Our Malecón was the stage for great comparsas and costumes, especially the Carnival of La Vega, Carnival of Santiago, Carnival of Cabral, Carnival of Bonao, in short, from all the corners of the country that starred in our great catwalk that is the Malecón of Puerto Plata, there was only one public: the people of Puerto Plata, eager to be the protagonists of their own stage.</p>
